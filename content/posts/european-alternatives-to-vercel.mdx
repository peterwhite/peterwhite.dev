If you're an EU company considering hosting data in the US, there are some important legal issues to keep in mind.

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets high standards for protecting personal data of EU residents, which includes getting explicit consent from individuals and using adequate security measures. However, the US has a different legal framework for data protection, with various state and federal laws that may not align with GDPR requirements.

One potential challenge is the conflict between GDPR and US surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA 702),

## What is FISA 702?

FISA 702 is a law allows the US government uses to collect information about individuals and organizations who are believed to be overseas, when _signals_ pass through the United States.

Under this law, the NSA can order vendors to reveal information about foreign users. For example, Google could be ordered to share email transcribes and search queries.

FISA 702 is up for reauthorization this year (2023) and is subject to criticism. For a more in-depth explanation, see [this summary](https://www.nytimes.com/article/warrantless-surveillance-section-702.html) from the New York Times.

To summarise, this can limit the ability of EU companies to comply with GDPR and EU data legalisation, as the vendor in the US could be compelled to reveal information.

## Privacy Shield and SCCs

To help address these concerns, the EU and US have created cross-border data transfer mechanisms like the Privacy Shield and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

Privacy Shield is an agreement between the EU and the US that allows companies to transfer personal data between the two regions.

However, Privacy Shield has faced significant challenges in balancing the interests of EU citizens' privacy rights and national security concerns:

- **Inadequate protection for EU citizens' data:** Privacy Shield doesn't give EU citizens the same rights as US citizens, and it allows US authorities to access personal data in ways that would be illegal in the EU.
- **Lack of oversight:** There's no independent supervisory authority to ensure that US companies are complying with the agreement's requirements, and there's no effective remedy for EU citizens whose data has been misused
- **Bypassing EU laws:** Some critics argue that Privacy Shield is essentially a way for the US to circumvent EU data protection laws. By relying on an agreement rather than complying with EU regulations, US companies may be able to avoid stricter privacy requirements and legal challenges.

## Vercel EU Alternatives

This leads to some companies trying to find alternatives to US-based vendors, including Vercel. Here's a quick list of alternatives:

- Self Host: NextJS can be self-hosted [with some limitations](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Projects like [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org) are trying to address these
- AWS: If you consider EU regions on AWS compliant, you can use [SST](https://sst.dev) to deploy
