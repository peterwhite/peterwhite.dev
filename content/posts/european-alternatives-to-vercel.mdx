If you're an EU company considering hosting data in the US, there are some important legal issues to keep in mind.

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets high standards for protecting personal data of EU residents, which includes getting explicit consent from individuals and using adequate security measures. However, the US has a different legal framework for data protection, with various state and federal laws that may not align with GDPR requirements.

One potential challenge is the conflict between GDPR and US surveillance laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which give the US government access to data held by US companies. This can limit the ability of EU companies to comply with GDPR and protect personal data.

To help address these concerns, the EU and US have created cross-border data transfer mechanisms like the Privacy Shield and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). However, these mechanisms have also faced legal challenges and uncertainties.

This leads to some companies trying to find alternatives to US-based vendors, including Vercel. Here's a quick list of alternatives:

- Self Host: NextJS can be self-hosted [with some limitations](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Projects like [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org) are trying to address these
- AWS: If you consider EU regions on AWS compliant, you can use [SST](https://sst.dev) to deploy
