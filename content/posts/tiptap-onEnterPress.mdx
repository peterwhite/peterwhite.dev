At Graphy, we use TipTap as our rich text WYSIWYG editor.

A common request is that the user can submit their content when they press enter.

This is easy for a simple HTML text area:

```html
<textarea onkeypress="onEnterFunction();"></textarea>
```

However, TipTap doesn't have an onKeyPress event. Instead, we'll need to make a custom extension that intercepts the enter key and runs a callback:

```typescript
import { Extension } from '@tiptap/core';

export const interceptNewline = (callback: () => void) => {
  return Extension.create({
    name: 'interceptNewline',

    addKeyboardShortcuts() {
      return {
        Enter: () => {
          callback();
          return true;
        },
      };
    },
  });
};
```

Then, in your editor config, use the extension and pass in your submit function:

```typescript
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [interceptNewline(yourFunctionHere)],
});
```

Now when the user presses enter, your callback will be run!
